# TopTrumps A recreation of my favourite card game (when I was 8). This is not part of my course, it's just for fun. 
The game is more or less complete but is not responsive and some of the code could, in hindsight, be improved 
(in particular, the players could be objects with multiple properties rather than several unconnected variables).
